# Cappy's Tdarr plugins

This is a collection of my plugins for [Tdarr](https://tdarr.io) that I created for my own personal use.

Most of these are forked from the original plugins and modified to suit my needs.

## Installation

Copy the contents of the `plugins` folder to your Tdarr plugins folder, maybe in the `Local` folder so
it gets picked up by Tdarr. That's it!

You may also simply create a file with the same name as the plugin and then just edit the file in the webapp.

## Plugins

- Cappy's HEVC Transcode/Optimization - Transcode to HEVC depending on the source codec and resolution if already not HEVC. Also optimizes existing HEVC files to conform to its standards for storage.
- Cappy's Audio standardization - Standardizes all audio tracks to the chosen codec if not already in that codec.
